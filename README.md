## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
This is a classification problem where the goal is to help financial institutions assess the risk of lending to a borrower, based on historical financial data. A well-performing model can help predict whether a loan will default, allowing companies to make more informed decisions and reduce financial risk.

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The dataset contains financial details of borrowers and their loans, including:

loan_size: The total size of the loan in monetary terms.
interest_rate: The annual interest rate applied to the loan.
borrower_income: The annual income of the borrower.
debt_to_income: The debt-to-income ratio, which helps assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan.
num_of_accounts: The number of active accounts the borrower has, reflecting their credit history.
derogatory_marks: The number of derogatory marks on the borrower's credit record, indicating poor credit history.
total_debt: The total amount of debt the borrower holds.

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
The main model explored for this classification task is Logistic Regression due to its interpretability and efficiency with binary classification problems. If necessary, additional models like Random Forests or XGBoost could be explored for potential improvements.

* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

    Accuracy: 0.99
Precision: 0.00 (Precision for the minority class, "Not Default", is undefined or extremely low since the model predicted only "Defaults".)
Recall: 0.00 (Recall for the "Not Default" class is also 0%, as no non-default loans were identified.)

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
Based on these results, Logistic Regression does not perform well for this problem due to the class imbalance. The model needs improvement in handling imbalanced data.
Since it only predicts the majority class (defaults), we cannot consider it an effective model.

* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

Yes, the performance is highly dependent on the problem being solved:

For this problem, it is important to correctly predict both defaults (0) and non-defaults (1), as both are important for lending decisions.
Recall for the "Not Default" class is critical because missing good loans can lead to lost opportunities. We should aim to increase the recall for the minority class.



If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
